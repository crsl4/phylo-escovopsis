# Fungi vesicles project

Collaboration with Quimi Vidaurre Montoya

Fungal groups have different vesicle shapes (spherical vs narrow). We want to understand the evolution of vesicle shapes on the tree (comparative methods), and test the hypothesis that the vesicles are disappearing (mutating into the conidiophores) and the phialide are moving to the hypha.

Ideas:
- ancestral reconstruction
- estimate mutation rate of the loss of vesicle to project into the future

# Data description
- Phylogenetic tree on strains
- Table linking strains to species
- Images of vesicles on the strains
