# Fungi vesicles project

Collaboration with Quimi Vidaurre Montoya

# Data

Quimi shared as a google drive `Claudia_data.rar`, which I unrar in my laptop:
```shell
brew install unrar
unrar x Claudia_data.rar
```
and then uploaded to a google shared drive.


## Meeting with Quimi (5/13) to discuss data
- not all leaves in images, only highlighted in tree PDF
- leaf names match folders with images
- long stem = conidiophores with one or multiple vesicles
- Interest in different vesicule shapes (I-V in PDF `Escovopsis_Microscopic-structures.pdf`)
- Some even present a shape like F (in PDF `Escovopsis_Microscopic-structures.pdf`)
